# Description

A simple web app to query Youtube API and get related results. Doing this to learn about the API and learning about personalizations.

Also includes Web Audio API to listen to music present on a remote server but due to copyright reasons I can't include any music here. The Youtube results can be played if an official copy of the music from the video is already present on the server.

Client-server architecture to make requests to Youtube API and display results in a card based format.

Now displays results related to current link.

Need to add SoundCloud API.
